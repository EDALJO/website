Website Structure
=================

This file summarises areas of this web site which still need tweaking. Please
add or remove items accordingly.

Fork Button
-----------


It would be great to have a fork button on the top of the page, see
<https://rust-lang.org>.

Quality Assurance
-----------------

The question arises whether this duplicates GitHub infrastructure, but on the
other hand, we have inactive maintainers, etc. and we should be able to get an
overview about important matters at a glance.

-   which languages of the website have translated alternatives and how many
    percent
-   last action of dictionary maintainer
