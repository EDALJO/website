Website Structure
=================

This file summarises areas of this web site which still need tweaking. Please
add or remove items accordingly.

Fork Button
-----------


It would be great to have a fork button on the top of the page, see
<https://rust-lang.org>.


Navigation Bar
--------------

Inspiration: <https://www.getlektor.com/docs/templates/navigation/>.

Mandatory items: Documentation Downloads Community Development

Preferred is a layout with subnavigation points over one with all possible items
in the navigation bar.

Downloads Page
--------------

Group languages like this:

    Afrikaans:
    * with _English_: afr-eng (0.1), eng-afr (0.2)
    * with _German_: afr-deu (x.x)

Currently it's a plain list, but the sorting would need javascript magic.

What's more:

*   display dictionary size
*   hovering over a link should give additional dictionary info: size
